* [[file:../lib/default.nix][aquaris.lib]]
Aquaris standard library for use in modules.

Functions:
- =merge=: [[https://noogle.dev/f/lib/recursiveUpdate][recursiveUpdate]] folded over a list of values

- =subsF=: Generalized text substitution function.
  Takes the following parameters as a set:
  - =file= (path): Path to the original file that should be read
  - =subs= (set of strings): Substitutions that should be applied to the file's content
  - =func=: Function that takes the filename and the substituted text
    and should output the result of =subsF=. Example: =pkgs.writeScript=

- =subsT=: A specialized version of =subsF= that just returns the text.

- =readLines=: Reads a file and returns the list of lines with =\n= stripped

- =importDir'=: A function to import Nix files in a directory.
  Takes two parameters:
  - a set containing:
    - =default= (boolean): should =default.nix= be included? Default: false
    - =dirs= (boolean): should directories be included? Default: true
  - the directory to import

- =importDir=: Identical to =importDir' {}= aka.: takes a directory,
  imports all files (except =default.nix=) and subdirectories.

- =adt=: Converts NixOS submodules into Algebraic Data Types ([[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_data_type][Wikipedia]]).
  Takes a set of submodules, functions to submodules
  or files containing the previous items.
  Returns a set of:
  - =is.foo=: Functions that checks if a given set is an instance of the =foo= submodule
  - =mk.foo=: Function that converts a given set into an instance of the =foo= submodule
  - =type=: Type value suitable for =lib.mkOption=

  The =is= and =mk= subsets include items for all passed submodules
  (=foo= is just an example)

  ADT instances are submodules with the added option =_tag=,
  set to the name of the instance.
  This means a submodule =foo= passed to =adt=
  would be given a default ~_tag = "foo";~ value.

  This is used by Aquaris's [[file:../module/filesystems/default.nix#L7][filesystem]] module
  (the actual type is passed [[file:../module/filesystems/partition.nix#L38][here]]).
