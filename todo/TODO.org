* Documentation
- how is the =aquaris= set passed to modules?
- the [[file:../module/commands/default.nix][commands]] module

* ZFS magic
Split security domain concept:
- root dataset:
  - uses key stored on TPM, gated by Secure Boot, managed by [[https://github.com/latchset/clevis][clevis]] and [[file:zfs-autokey.nix][zfs-autokey]]
  - or: ZFS on LUKS, managed by systemd-cryptenroll
  - track [[https://github.com/nix-community/lanzaboote/issues/348][this]] PR for binding to OS-specific PCRs
- user datasets:
  - use user passwords as keys, managed by [[file:zfs-pam][zfs-pam]]
  - or maybe something like [[https://github.com/jkool702/systemd-homed_ZFS][this]]?
