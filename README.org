* Aquaris - [WIP] My NixOS module library
Use Aquaris to easily manage related machines, their users and secrets!

Check out the example configuration to see how this looks in practice:
- [[file:default.nix][default.nix]] - Definition of users and machines
- [[file:machines/castor/default.nix][machines/castor/default.nix]] - A machine-specific configuration

Or create a blank configuration from the template by running:
#+begin_src shell
  nix flake new -t github:42loco42/aquaris <name>
#+end_src

** Secrets management
Aquaris includes a powerful secrets management facility (AQS),
with secrets belonging to one of three categories:
- toplevel: included by all NixOS configurations
- user: personal secrets like SSH keys or password hashes,
  readable only by their owner and machines they're on
- machine: secrets for machines like API keys or TLS certificates,
  readable only by the respective machine and its admin accounts

This is inspired by [[https://github.com/ryantm/agenix][agenix]], but without the need to explicitly define
the list of secrets and their corresponding public keys.
Secrets are managed via the [[file:docs/aqs.org][aqs]] command exported by this flake.

* Module reference
** [[file:modules/basic.nix][basic]]
- Configures a lot of basic system options, including sane defaults for Nix
- Creates the user accounts
*** Options (=aquaris.machine=)
- =secretKey=: Location of the SSH secret key;
  should be changed when using an ephemeral root storage
  (default: =/etc/ssh/ssh_host_ed25519_key=)
- =keyMap=: Key map of the system consoles (default =de-latin1=)
- =locale=: System locale (default =en_US.UTF-8=)
- =timeLocale=: Locale to display the time in (LC_TIME) (default =de_DE.UTF-8=)
- =timeZone=: Time zone of the system (default =Europe/Berlin=)

** [[file:modules/filesystem.nix][filesystem]]
- A declarative filesystem configuration library inspired by [[https://github.com/nix-community/disko][disko]]
- Much simpler to configure, faster execution, handles edge cases
  (e.g. I couldn't get disko to mount a tmpfs on =/=
  unless running in disko mode, which would also reformat the disks)
- [[file:docs/filesystem.org][Options documentation]]

** [[file:modules/home.nix][home]]
- Configures the user home environment
- Shell: [[https://www.zsh.org/][zsh]] using the [[https://ohmyz.sh/][ohymzsh]] configuration framework
- Editor: [[https://neovim.io/][neovim]]
- Enables git, htop, tmux and a bunch of other useful tools
- Adds the following commands:
  - =use=: wrapper around =nix shell=,
    prepends =nixpkgs= to package names by default
    (e.g. =use sbctl= runs =nix shell nixpkgs#sbctl=)
  - =switch=: builds & activates the NixOS configuration in =$HOME/config=

** [[file:modules/lanza.nix][lanza]]
- Enables [[https://github.com/nix-community/lanzaboote/][lanzaboote]], a Secure Boot-capable boot loader
- Automatically creates Secure Boot key with [[https://github.com/Foxboron/sbctl][sbctl]]
- Lanzaboote is fetched from [[https://42loco42.cachix.org][my binary cache]], so no lengthy Rust compilation process!

** [[file:modules/persist.nix][persist]]
- Tools for working with persistent files on a system with ephemeral root storage
- Inspired by [[https://github.com/nix-community/impermanence][impermanence]], but much simpler
- Designed to be used only with directories
- All system dirs are bind-mounted, all user dirs are symlinked
*** Options (=aquaris.persist=)
- =root=: Location of the persistent root directory (default =/persist=)
- =system=: List of persistent system paths.
  Default entries: =/etc/secureboot=, =/var/db/sudo=, =/var/log=
- =users.<name>=:
  For each user in the set: list of its persistent paths.

** [[file:modules/secrets.nix][secrets]]
- Integrates secrets into system configurations
- Secrets are decrypted from [[file:secrets/][<flake>/secrets/]] to =aquaris.secretsDir= (=/run/secrets/= by default)
*** Options (=aquaris.secrets.<name>=)
- =source=: Path to the age file for this secret
- =outPath=: Path to the decrypted secret.
  This option allows to use the secret as a string, e.g.
  =${config.aquaris.secrets.example}=
- =user=: User that owns this secret
- =group=: Group of this secret. Won't automatically get read access!
- =mode=: Mode/Permissions of the secret (default =0400=, meaning only the user can read it)

Keep in mind that all values are set to sane defaults by AQS,
there is usually no need to override them.

* [TODO] Not yet pulled from Incubator
A lot of useful stuff is still stuck deep within [[https://github.com/42LoCo42/.dotfiles][my dotfiles]], particularly [[https://github.com/42LoCo42/.dotfiles/tree/9f159dc820160311c4c1ab5f7abbb54d854c8d94/machines/test][the test VM]].
All of that code needs to be cleaned up and prepared for independent usage.
I especially want to make all my research into split security domain ZFS systems
available as easy-to-use NixOS modules, since there are quite some challenges involved.
This includes:
- automatic system dataset key management ([[https://github.com/42LoCo42/.dotfiles/blob/9f159dc820160311c4c1ab5f7abbb54d854c8d94/machines/test/zfs-autokey.nix][zfs-autokey]])
- reliable unlocking of user datasets at login ([[https://github.com/42LoCo42/.dotfiles/blob/9f159dc820160311c4c1ab5f7abbb54d854c8d94/zfs-pam][zfs-pam]])
