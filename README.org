* Aquaris - [WIP] My NixOS module library
** [TODO] [[file:agenix.nix][agenix]]
- Helper for [[https://github.com/ryantm/agenix][agenix]], a Nix secrets management tool
- Automatically imports all secrets
- TODO: Easier management of secrets, no need to create a secrets.nix
*** Options
- =keyPath=: where the agenix master key is located (default =/etc/age.key=)

** [[file:customize.nix][customize]]
- Configures the user account
- Sets the system locale, TTY key map and timezone
*** Options
- =userName=: name of the primary (=default=) user account
- =publicKey=: the SSH public key of that user, set as an authorized key
- =keyMap=: TTY key map (default =de-latin1=)
- =locale=: the system locale (default =en_US.UTF-8=)
- =timeZone=: the system time zone (default =Europe/Berlin=)

** [[file:lanza.nix][lanza]]
- Enables [[https://github.com/nix-community/lanzaboote/][lanzaboote]], a Secure Boot-capable boot loader
- Automatically creates Secure Boot key with [[https://github.com/Foxboron/sbctl][sbctl]]
- Lanzaboote is fetched from [[https://42loco42.cachix.org][my binary cache]], so no lengthy Rust compilation process!

** [[file:nix-settings.nix][nix-settings]]
- Enables Flakes and sets some more sane defaults for Nix
- Includes [[https://42loco42.cachix.org][my binary cache]] into the system substituters list
- Allows to link flake inputs to =NIX_PATH= and the system flake registry
*** Options
- =linkChannel=: whether to link =NIX_PATH= to the =nixpkgs= input
- =linkInputs=: the list of flake inputs to link to the system flake registry

** [[file:sys-settings.nix][sys-settings]]
- Enables SSH with secure defaults
- Configures various parts of the base system to be nice
- Sets the machine and host ID based on a common value
- Links the current config to =/etc/nixos=
*** Options
- =hostName=: the host name (TODO set from name of NixOS config)
- =machineID=: the machine ID, generate with =dbus-uuidgen=
- =sshHostKeyPath=: path of the ed25519 host key
  (can be different for systems with ephemeral root storage)
- =linkCurrentConfig=: link the system config to =/etc/nixos= (default enabled)

** [TODO] Not yet pulled from Incubator
A lot of useful stuff is still stuck deep within [[https://github.com/42LoCo42/.dotfiles][my dotfiles]], particularly [[https://github.com/42LoCo42/.dotfiles/tree/nixos/machines/test][the test VM]].
All of that code needs to be cleaned up and prepared for independent usage.
I especially want to make all my research into split security domain ZFS systems
available as easy-to-use NixOS modules, since there are quite some challenges involved.
This includes:
- automatic [[https://github.com/nix-community/disko][disko]] config creation
- automatic system dataset key management ([[https://github.com/42LoCo42/.dotfiles/blob/nixos/machines/test/zfs-autokey.nix][zfs-autokey]])
- reliable unlocking of user datasets at login ([[https://github.com/42LoCo42/.dotfiles/blob/nixos/zfs-pam][zfs-pam]])
- a more controlled way than [[https://github.com/nix-community/impermanence][impermanence]] of managing persistent files ([[https://github.com/42LoCo42/.dotfiles/blob/nixos/machines/test/feengold.nix][feengold]])
